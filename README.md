# THE-World-Uni-Ranking

This portfolio is part of an exercise from Career Foundry's Data Immersion course. 

For this open project, I've selected the world university ranking dataset from Times Higher Education. Upon exploring the dataset, I've decided to pretend that the stakeholders are Times Higher Education management staff. 

# Objective

Times Higher Education stakeholders are interested in the following: 

- How is the THE's ranking system doing voerall?
- Are the indicators strong predictor of the total ranking scores?
- Are the indicators representiative of the total ranking scores?

# Data

The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters:

- University name
- Country
- Total scores
- Indicators scores (e.g. research, teaching, international, income, citations)
- Number of students
- Student to staff ratio
- International students
- Female to male ratio
- Year

Note the dataset also contains ranking details for two other ranking bodies (shanghai ranking an CWUR ranking), education attainment and exducation private/public expenditure. However, these not not used in this project. 

The World University Ranking Dataset is accessible from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings).
